## App description

Cell Dysplasia Annotation App enables the user to annotate microscopic images of blood cells. 
There are three main indicators pathologists use to detect whether a cell is dysplasic or not. These are:

**a)** Check for absence of granularity in the cell's cytoplasm. A healthy cell presents a certain granularity in the cytoplasm.

**b)** Check for Hyperchromasia. A dysplastic cell will display an increased chromatin content resulting in a deeply stained nuclei. 

**c)** Number of lobes of cell nuclei. A healthy cell usually present between 2 and 5 lobes.

Other factors to bear in mind are:

**d)** Ratio between the nuclei and the cytoplasm as Dysplastic cells present a larger nuclei than healthy ones

**e)** An increase of the Miotic figures.

- Select an image directory
- Navigate the images in directory 
- Freehand draw, using the mouse to highlight specific areas of the image.
- Select annotation type Cytoplasm(Granules / Transparent), Chromatin (Heterogenic / Homogenic), NÂº of Lobes (Normal / Abnormal)
- Export the annotations made as a txt file (json format) and as an image.
